# Various Models

## Supervised / Unsupervised Models

### Introduction
- In this kernel I will deal with various models on data analysis. By using various predictive models, I will see how accurate they are in detecting train / test datas. 
- By learning in details, I hope I will be able to analyze some important aspects of the dataset. Let's start!

## 1. Unsupervised Models
- Clustering
    - Clustering is one of the machine-learning methods that classify the datas by the similar characteristics. It us commonly used in pattern recognition or sorting the similar news. KMeans, DBSCAN, Hierachical clustering, Spectral Clustering are the examples of Clustering algorithm. 

    - Image below is the comparision graph about the Clustering algorithm performances.
